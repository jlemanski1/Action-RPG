# Action RPG

Inspired by the Diablo series & Path of Exile, I started this project to have something fun to work on while learning new skills and practices. 

It was abandoned for awhile during the school year but I am getting back to it. I hope to add more systems and polish the current ones, before unifying the design and artstyle. This README will be added to and polished as I get back up to speed on the codebase and delve back into the project.

## Contributing

This is a personal project meant for learning so I'm expecting/hoping to do everything myself, art and programming included. While unlikely, if anyone comes across this and wants to contribute, please contact me, that would be more than welcome.
